        </div>
        <div>
            <strong>Elon Musk:</strong> "I'm not suggesting we abandon Earth. We can and should pursue both goals with a balanced approach."
        </div>
        <div>
            <strong>Bill Gates:</strong> "How do you propose we balance such enormous investments for Mars while still addressing Earth's needs effectively?"
        </div>
        <div>
            <strong>Elon Musk:</strong> "By driving innovation and creating new industries, we can generate the wealth necessary to tackle both challenges simultaneously."
